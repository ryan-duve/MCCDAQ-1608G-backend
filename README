Special Notes on compiling the libhid version.

1. You must have installed the following packages
      libusb
      libusb-devel
      libusb-static

   For example, on Fedora Core 8, they would be
      libusb-static-0.1.12-10.fc8
      libusb-0.1.12-10.fc8
      libusb-devel-0.1.12-10.fc8

   An easy way to get this is:
     yum install libusb libusb-devel libusb-static

   or on Ubuntu
     apt-get install libusb libusb-dev libusb-static

2. You need to make and install the latest version of libhid
   Instructions on doing this is at http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/.

   Under Debian/Ubuntu:  apt-get install libhid-dev python-hid
  
   Under RedHat: svn co svn://svn.debian.org/libhid/trunk libhid-svn
   cd libhid-svn
   sh ./autogen.sh
   make
   make install
   (There may be some tweaking under FC6.  You might want to disable SWIG).

   Note!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   Ubuntu stopped distributing libhid.  Follow these steps:
   1. visit http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/ and scroll down to the "Getting
      libhid" secion and download the tarball:
       http://alioth.debian.org/frs/download.php/file/1958/libhid-02.16.tar.gz

   2. untar and cd into libhid-0.2.16
      Since gcc has -Wall -Werror enabled, which is a GOOD thing, when the
      libhid software builds, it complains about a set but unused variable
      in the libhid-02.16/tests/lshid.c test program.  The line in question
      is already a workaround for a different type of compiler error and is
      only in there to make gcc happy, but the easiest fix is to change
      line 41 from:
           len = *((unsigned ling*)custom);
      to:
           if (len) len = *((unsigned ling*)custom);

       Now go back up to the libhid-0.2.16 directory and:
           ./configure; sudo make install


3. Get the file 60-mcc.rules (or 61-mcc.rules for Linux 3.X) from ftp://lx10.tx.ncsu.edu/pub/Linux/drivers
   cp 60-mcc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
   /sbin/udevcontrol --reload_rules 
             or
   /sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules
             or
   /sbin/udevadm control --reload
             or 
         ... (udev changes a lot so see the man page for the incantation de jour)

4. NOW you are ready to compile the MCC libhid programs
   tar zxvf  MCCLIBHID.1.52.tgz
   cd libhid
   make
   make install
